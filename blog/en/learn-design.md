People often ask me how to learn design. And since I'm mostly web developer,
I get this question mostly from web developers. I decided to write this blog
post to redirect people that ask this question.

In this article, I will show you 4 resources which will help you learn design
as a web developer.

So to the point, here is a list of 4 resources where you can learn web design.

1. [Design for Hackers](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956) by David Kadavy

[![Design for Hackers Book Cover](/img/design-for-hackers-cover.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956)

This is the only book on this list that I've read. And I plan to read it again.
It's great intro to design for non-designers. In Poland where I live it's out of print,
and hard to get in dead tree format.

2. [Design for Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=jcubic&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&a_aid=jcubic&a_bid=5f6ba095) by Stephanie Stimac

[![Design for Developers Book Cover](/img/design-for-developers-cover.jpg)](https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=jcubic&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&a_aid=jcubic&a_bid=5f6ba095)

I've purchased this book from [Manning](https://www.manning.com/), but I didn't read it yet.
The above link is Affiliate, so I get some percent if you buy it. I think that I will get something
if you buy anything after visiting the website.

3. [The Non-Designer's Design Book](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Typographic-Principles/dp/0133966151) by Robin Williams

[![The Non-Designer's Design Book Cover](/img/non-designer-cover.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Typographic-Principles/dp/0133966151)

This book is also on my list of books to read. Right now you can buy 4th edition, it's always better to buy the latest improved version.

4. [Foundations of Design for Developers](https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/design-story/ebook--foundations-of-design-for-developers) by Kathryn Grayson Nanz

[![Foundations of Design for Developers e-book Cover](/img/design-foundations-cover.png)](https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/design-story/ebook--foundations-of-design-for-developers)

The last on the list is a free e-book, you need to add your personal details to download.

## [Summary](#summary)
I strongly believe that every web developer should learn basics for design, especially if he or she does anything front-end related. Even if that would be really basic. Knowledge about design can be invaluable, especially if you're a new developer, and want to create projects for your portfolio that will stand out. It's always better to show something that looks good.
